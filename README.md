i. Background
PayLater is an additional revenue stream from established ecosystems such as e-commerce platforms or ride-hailing services. By determining whether existing customers within these ecosystems will adopt PayLater, businesses can gain revenue without incurring extra costs for customer acquisition (non-profit on customer acquisition), and benefit from marketing cost efficiency and reduced communication costs.

ii. Problem Statement and Objectives
$SpendWise$ aims to predict whether an existing customer will adopt PayLater based on their demographic and shopping behavior. A machine learning model will be developed using algorithms such as KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Adaptive Boosting. These models will be tested on training and testing datasets, then compared based on evaluation metrics such as recall and F1-score. The model with the highest recall and F1-score will be selected for deployment to predict new data.

The recall metric is prioritized to ensure the model detects as many true positive cases as possible, minimizing misclassification of critical data. Meanwhile, F1-score is chosen to strike a balance between precision and recall, ensuring the model is not only accurate but also consistently reliable in detecting risks.
